            <p class="c2">Hello!, This is my Family<br>
                I live in a nuclear family.
                The nuclear family is the traditional type of family structure. 
                our family type consists of two parents and two children. 
                The nuclear family was long held in esteem by society as being the ideal in which to raise children. 
                Children in nuclear families receive strength and stability from the two-parent structure and generally
                 have more opportunities due to the financial ease of two adults.
